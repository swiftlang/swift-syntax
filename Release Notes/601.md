# Swift Syntax 601 Release Notes

## New APIs

- `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax` and `FloatLiteralExprSyntax` now have a computed `representedLiteralValue` property.
  - Description: Allows retrieving the represented literal value when valid.
  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/405
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2605
    
- `SyntaxProtocol` now has a method `ancestorOrSelf`.
  - Description: Returns the node or the first ancestor that satisfies `condition`.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/pull/2696

## API Behavior Changes

- `SyntaxProtocol.trimmed` detaches the node
  - Description: Getting a trimmed version of a node detaches it from its parent. Having the trimmed node be attached to a parent was not intuitive because eg. printing the parent node would have the trimmed trivia missing, most likely forming invalid Swift code.
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2689

## Deprecations

- `IncrementalEdit` deprecated in favor of `SourceEdit`
  - Description: `IncrementalEdit` is being dropped for `SourceEdit`. `SourceEdit` has deprecated compatibility layers to make it API-compatible with `IncrementalEdit`
  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/2532
  - Pull request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2604

## API-Incompatible Changes

- Moved `Radix` and `IntegerLiteralExprSyntax.radix` from `SwiftRefactor` to `SwiftSyntax`.
  - Description: Allows retrieving the radix value from the `literal.text`.
  - Issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues/405
  - Pull Request: https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/pull/2605
